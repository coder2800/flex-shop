### Working on frontend
---
Firstly the user will have to `sign-up` to the website.
The `sign-up` page looks like this:

![SignUpPage](/Devansh-new/images%20(1)/Screenshot%20(231).png)
---


After signing up the user will be directed to the home page of the website:

![HomePage](/Devansh-new/images%20(1)/Screenshot%20(223).png)
---

Now the user may choose to click on the `buy now` button or the `sell now` button depending on his needs:

If the user clicks on `buy now` button then he is directed to the buyer homepage:

![buyerHomePage](/Devansh-new/images%20(1)/Screenshot%20(222).png)
---

On choosing the category of products which the user wants to buy, the user will be directed to the page of that category:

![productPage](/Devansh-new/images%20(1)/Screenshot%20(230).png)
---

On choosing the products he wants to buy, the user is directed to the cart page:

![cartPage](/Devansh-new/images%20(1)/Screenshot%20(228).png)
---


If the user clicks `Sell now` button then he is directed to the seller homepage:

![SellerHomePage](/Devansh-new/images%20(1)/Screenshot%20(224).png)
---

After this, the user is directed to the details page in which he has to enter all the details of the product which he is selling:

![detailsPage](/Devansh-new/images%20(1)/Screenshot%20(225).png)
---

After this the user will be directed to the address page:

![addressPage](/Devansh-new/images%20(1)/Screenshot%20(226).png)
---

After this the user will be directed to the payment page:

![paymentPage](/Devansh-new/images%20(1)/Screenshot%20(227).png)
---

There is also an about us page:

![aboutPage](/Devansh-new/images%20(1)/Screenshot%20(233).png)
---

And also a contact us page:

![contactUs](/Devansh-new/images%20(1)/Screenshot%20(232).png)
---


and many more pages...

### Working on backend
---

We have done authentication of users through backend like if a user didn't have an sign up earlier then, the user needs to sign up first as seen in frontend.
After that the user will get token to access the pages.

For doing this, we require some npm modules like:<br><br>
-> express<br>
-> cors<br>
-> Jwt(Jsonwebtoken)<br>
-> bcryp<br>
